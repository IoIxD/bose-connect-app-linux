# BoseÂ® Connect App for Linux

--- Not Official App ---

Based on [Denton-L project][Denton-L] because it is not maintained anymore.
Also, it has some interesting Merge Request. I created a copy to have an active
repository. The original license is GPL-3.0 License as the original repository
shown, I keep this license.


Connect App for Linux
=====================

If you own a Bose device, you'll know that `Bose Connect` is not available on
Linux. This program attempts to reverse engineer that app to give the device
Linux support.
